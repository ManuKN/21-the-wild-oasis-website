===========================================================

**Overview**
------------

This JavaScript file contains a React component named `DateSelector` that provides a date range picker for selecting dates. The component also displays pricing information and a total cost based on the selected dates.

**Features**
------------

* Date range picker with a minimum and maximum booking length
* Pricing information display with discount and total cost calculation
* Clear button to reset the selected date range

**Code Breakdown**
-----------------

### `isAlreadyBooked(range, datesArr)`

* **Name**: `isAlreadyBooked`
* **Purpose**: Checks if a date range is already booked by verifying if any date within the range is present in the provided array of dates.
* **Parameters**:
	+ `range`: An object with `from` and `to` properties representing the date range.
	+ `datesArr`: An array of dates to check against.
* **Returns**: A boolean indicating whether the date range is already booked.
* **Notes**: This function uses the `isWithinInterval` function from the `date-fns` library to check if a date is within the specified range.

### `DateSelector`

* **Name**: `DateSelector`
* **Purpose**: A React component that renders a date range picker and displays pricing information.
* **Parameters**: None
* **Returns**: A JSX element representing the date selector component.
* **Notes**: This component uses the `DayPicker` component from the `react-day-picker` library to render the date range picker.

**Usage Examples**
-----------------

```jsx
import DateSelector from './DateSelector';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <DateSelector />
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Notes**
-------

* The `DateSelector` component assumes that the `date-fns` and `react-day-picker` libraries are installed and imported correctly.
* The component uses a fixed pricing structure and does not account for dynamic pricing changes.
* The `isAlreadyBooked` function is not used within the `DateSelector` component, but is included in the code for potential future use.

**Language-Specific Notes**
-------------------------

* This code uses JavaScript and React, with specific dependencies on `date-fns` and `react-day-picker` libraries.
* The code uses JSX syntax for rendering React components.
* The `isWithinInterval` function from `date-fns` is used to check if a date is within a specified range.
